# Exercise 1: Favorite Numbers

# Key Python Topics:

# Sets
# Adding/removing items in a set
# Set concatenation (using union)


# Instructions:

# Create a set called my_fav_numbers and populate it with your favorite numbers.
# Add two new numbers to the set.
# Remove the last number you added to the set.
# Create another set called friend_fav_numbers and populate it with your friend’s favorite numbers.
# Concatenate my_fav_numbers and friend_fav_numbers to create a new set called our_fav_numbers.
# Note: Sets are unordered collections, so ensure no duplicate numbers are added.

my_fav_numbers = {10, 13, 6, 1}
my_fav_numbers.update([3, 11])
my_fav_numbers.remove(11)
friend_fav_numbers = {2, 4, 10, 8}
our_fav_numbers = my_fav_numbers.union(friend_fav_numbers)
print(our_fav_numbers)


# Exercise 2: Tuple

# Key Python Topics:

# Tuples (immutability)


# Instructions:

# Given a tuple of integers, try to add more integers to the tuple.
# Hint: Tuples are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed after creation. Think about why you can’t add more integers to a tuple.

my_tuple = (1,2,3,4)

# Conclusion:
# You can’t add more integers to a tuple because tuples are immutable, and immutability means the object cannot be changed after it is created.


# Exercise 3: List Manipulation

# Key Python Topics:

# Lists
# List methods: append, remove, insert, count, clear

# Instructions:

# You have a list: basket = ["Banana", "Apples", "Oranges", "Blueberries"]
# Remove "Banana" from the list.
# Remove "Blueberries" from the list.
# Add "Kiwi" to the end of the list.
# Add "Apples" to the beginning of the list.
# Count how many times "Apples" appear in the list.
# Empty the list.
# Print the final state of the list.


basket = ["Banana", "Apples", "Oranges", "Blueberries"]
basket.remove("Banana")
basket.pop()
basket.append("Kiwi")
basket.insert(0, "Apples")
apple_count = basket.count("Apples")
basket.clear()
print(basket)


# Exercise 4: Floats

# Key Python Topics:

# Lists
# Floats and integers
# Range generation


# Instructions:

# Recap: What is a float? What’s the difference between a float and an integer?
# Create a list containing the following sequence of mixed types: floats and integers:
# 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5.
# Avoid hard-coding each number manually.
# Think: Can you generate this sequence using a loop or another method?


# An integer (int) is used to represent whole numbers and is best suited for counting and exact values.
# A float (float) is used to represent decimal numbers and is useful when precision with fractions is required.

numbers = []
for x in range(3, 11):
    numbers.append(x * 0.5)

print(numbers)


# Exercise 5: For Loop

# Key Python Topics:

# Loops (for)
# Range and indexing


# Instructions:

# Write a for loop to print all numbers from 1 to 20, inclusive.
# Write another for loop that prints every number from 1 to 20 where the index is even.


for number in range(1, 21):
    print(number)

for number in range(1, 21):
    if number % 2 == 0:
        print(number)


# Exercise 6: While Loop

# Key Python Topics:

# Loops (while)
# Conditionals


# Instructions:

# Use an input to ask the user to enter their name.
# Using a while True loop, check if the user gave a proper name (not digits and at least 3 letters long)
# hint: check for the method isdigit()
# if the input is incorrect, keep asking for the correct input until it is correct
# if the input is correct print “thank you” and break the loop



user_name = input("Enter your name: ")
while True:
    if not user_name.isdigit() and len(user_name) >= 3:
        print("thank you")
        break
    else:
         user_name = input("give the correct name: ")



# Exercise 7: Favorite Fruits

# Key Python Topics:

# Input/output
# Strings and lists
# Conditionals


# Instructions:

# Ask the user to input their favorite fruits (they can input several fruits, separated by spaces).
# Store these fruits in a list.
# Ask the user to input the name of any fruit.
# If the fruit is in their list of favorite fruits, print:
# "You chose one of your favorite fruits! Enjoy!"
# If not, print:
# "You chose a new fruit. I hope you enjoy it!"

user_fruits = list(input("input your favorite fruits "))
for fruit in user_fruits:
    user_fruit = input("any fruit ")
    if fruit == user_fruit:
        print("You chose one of your favorite fruits! Enjoy!")
    else:
        print("You chose a new fruit. I hope you enjoy it!")
    break


# Exercise 8: Pizza Toppings

# Key Python Topics:

# Loops
# Lists
# String formatting


# Instructions:

# Write a loop that asks the user to enter pizza toppings one by one.
# Stop the loop when the user types 'quit'.
# For each topping entered, print:
# "Adding [topping] to your pizza."
# After exiting the loop, print all the toppings and the total cost of the pizza.
# The base price is $10, and each topping adds $2.50.


toppings = []
base_price = 10
topping_price = 2.5

while True: 
    topping = input("Enter a pizza topping (or type 'quit' to finish): ")
    if topping == 'quit':
        break
    
    toppings.append(topping)
    print(f"Adding {topping} to your pizza.") 


total_cost = base_price + len(toppings) * topping_price

print("Your pizza has the following toppings:")
for t in toppings:
    print("-", t)

print(f"Total cost: ${total_cost}")



# Exercise 9: Cinemax Tickets

# Key Python Topics:

# Conditionals
# Lists
# Loops


# Instructions:

# Ask for the age of each person in a family who wants to buy a movie ticket.
# Calculate the total cost based on the following rules:
# Free for people under 3.
# $10 for people aged 3 to 12.
# $15 for anyone over 12.
# Print the total ticket cost.


# Bonus:

# Imagine a group of teenagers wants to see a restricted movie (only for ages 16–21).
# Write a program to:
# Ask for each person’s age.
# Remove anyone who isn’t allowed to watch.
# Print the final list of attendees.


total_price = 0
family = []

while True:
    family_age = input("Enter the age of a family member (or type 'quit' to finish): ")
    if family_age == "quit":
        break

    age = int(family_age)
    family.append(age)
    if age < 3:
        price = 0
    elif age <= 12:
        price = 10
    else:
        price = 15
    
    total_price += price

print("Ages entered:" ,age)
print("Total ticket cost: $", total_price)

# Bonus:

# Imagine a group of teenagers wants to see a restricted movie (only for ages 16–21).
# Write a program to:
# Ask for each person’s age.
# Remove anyone who isn’t allowed to watch.
# Print the final list of attendees.


people = []
while True:
    people_age = input("Enter age (or type 'quit' to finish): ")
