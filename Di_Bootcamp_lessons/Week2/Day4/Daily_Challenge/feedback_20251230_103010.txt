suggestions for improvement:
- For Challenge 1, the output should be a comma-separated string, not a list. Use `.join()` to achieve this.
- In Challenge 2, the `return` statement is inside the `for` loop, so it only checks the first word. Move it outside the loop to check all words.
- In Challenge 2, remove the print statement `print(words_in_sentence)` to keep the output clean
Brief justification:
- correctness: Challenge 1 is mostly correct, getting input, splitting, sorting, but fails to join the sorted list into a comma-separated string (75%). Challenge 2 is incorrect, the `return` statement being inside the loop causes it to only return the first word. Thus, it does not accurately find the longest word as described in the instructions. (75%)
- readability: The code is well-commented and easy to follow, aligning with good readability practices.
- performance: The code uses appropriate methods and has reasonable performance for the given tasks.
- security: The code does not seem to have any major security vulnerabilities for this challenge.
