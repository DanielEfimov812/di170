suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding docstrings to your methods to explain their purpose and parameters.
- The code for `get_short_info` could be simplified using more advanced string formatting techniques.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately implements all the required functionalities including Farm class creation, `__init__`, `add_animal`, `get_info`, `get_animal_types`, and `get_short_info` methods. It correctly uses dictionaries, string formatting, conditional logic, and list manipulation as described in the Chapter Content/Questions. The `add_animal` method is also correctly upgraded to use `**kwargs`.
- readability: The code is well-structured and easy to follow, with clear variable names and method definitions. However, adding docstrings could enhance readability further.
- performance: The code demonstrates good performance. The operations are efficient and appropriate for the given tasks. The use of `sorted()` for animal types is performant.
- security: The code does not involve any user input or external data, minimizing security risks. The operations performed are safe and do not introduce vulnerabilities.
