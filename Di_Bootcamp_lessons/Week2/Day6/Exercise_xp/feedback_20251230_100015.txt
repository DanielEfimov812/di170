suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding a conditional check in the `add_animal` method of the `Zoo` class to prevent adding an animal if it already exists.
- For the Song class, the output in the instructions is incorrect, it shows all lines concatenated, where each line should have been printed on separate lines. The current implementation is correct.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately implements all four exercises as described in the chapter content. Exercise 1 correctly creates Cat objects, finds the oldest, and prints its details. Exercise 2 creates Dog objects, implements bark and jump methods, and calls them. Exercise 3 creates a Song class and prints the lyrics line by line. Exercise 4 implements the Zoo class with all the required methods (add, get, sell, sort, group animals) and produces the expected output. Thus, the code's correctness aligns perfectly with the chapter's instructions.
- readability: The code is generally well-structured and easy to follow, with clear variable names and comments that explain the purpose of each section. However, the extensive comments repeating the instructions within the code can be slightly reduced to improve conciseness.
- performance: The code demonstrates good performance for the given tasks. The algorithms used are efficient for the scale of the problems presented, with no unnecessary complexity. List operations and dictionary lookups are performed in a timely manner.
- security: The code does not involve any external input or sensitive operations, so there are no significant security concerns. It focuses on object creation and manipulation, which are inherently safe in this context.
